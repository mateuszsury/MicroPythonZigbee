# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to the main branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for unpatched security vulnerabilities.

Use GitHub Security Advisories (preferred) or contact the maintainer directly.
Include:
- affected commit/version
- impact summary
- reproduction steps or proof of concept
- suggested mitigation (if available)

## Response Targets

- Initial acknowledgement: within 72 hours
- Triage update: within 7 days
- Fix timeline: depends on severity and hardware reproducibility

## Scope Notes

Because this project integrates firmware, runtime C bindings, and radio networking:
- reports should include board model and firmware profile
- include whether issue reproduces in host tests, HIL tests, or both
